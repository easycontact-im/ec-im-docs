## Overview

Groups allow you to organize users into logical collections and manage their access collectively. When you assign roles to a group, all members automatically inherit those permissions. This makes it easy to onboard new team members and ensure consistent access across your organization.

## Why Use Groups?

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Simplified Onboarding">
    When a new team member joins:

    **Without Groups:**
    1. Create user account
    2. Identify all needed roles
    3. Assign each role individually
    4. Hope you didn't miss anything

    **With Groups:**
    1. Create user account
    2. Add to appropriate group(s)
    3. Done — they inherit all necessary permissions
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Consistent Access">
    Groups ensure everyone on a team has the same access:

    - No forgotten permission assignments
    - No accidental over-provisioning
    - Easy to audit who has what access
    - Changes apply to everyone at once
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Easy Offboarding">
    When someone leaves or changes teams:

    - Remove from group(s) to revoke access instantly
    - No need to track individual role assignments
    - Permissions are automatically cleaned up
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Managing Group Members

### Viewing Members

To see who's in a group:

1. Find the group in the list
2. Click the **three-dot menu** (⋮)
3. Select **Manage Members**

The dialog shows two panels:
- **Left panel** — Current members with option to remove
- **Right panel** — Available users to add

### Adding Members

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Manage Members">
    Click the three-dot menu and select **Manage Members**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search for Users">
    Use the search bar in the right panel to find users by name or email
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Users">
    Click the **+** button next to each user you want to add
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Addition">
    The user moves to the left panel and immediately gains group permissions
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Users already in the group won't appear in the search results, preventing duplicate additions.
</Info>

### Removing Members

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Manage Members">
    Click the three-dot menu and select **Manage Members**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find the Member">
    Locate the user in the left panel (current members)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Remove User">
    Click the **remove** button next to their name
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Removal">
    The user is removed and immediately loses group-inherited permissions
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Removing someone from a group only revokes permissions inherited from that group. Any directly assigned roles remain intact.
</Note>

## How Group Permissions Work

### Permission Inheritance

When a user is added to a group, they automatically inherit all roles assigned to that group.

```
User joins "Engineering Team" group
         ↓
Group has roles: "Incident Editor", "Schedule Viewer"
         ↓
User receives: incident:read, incident:write, schedule:read
```

### Multiple Group Membership

Users can belong to multiple groups. Their effective permissions are the **union** of:
- Directly assigned roles
- All roles from all groups they belong to

<Accordion title="Example: Multiple Groups">
  **User: Alex**

  Direct Roles:
  - None

  Group Memberships:
  - **Engineering Team** → Incident Editor
  - **On-Call Responders** → Incident Admin, Schedule Editor

  **Effective Permissions:**
  - All Incident Editor permissions ✓
  - All Incident Admin permissions ✓
  - All Schedule Editor permissions ✓

  Alex has the combined permissions of both groups.
</Accordion>

### Permission Resolution

Permissions are additive — you can only gain more access through groups, never less.

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| User has role A, group adds role B | User has A + B |
| User is in two groups with same role | No change (role counted once) |
| User removed from group | Loses only that group's roles |

## Common Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Team-Based Access">
    Create groups for each team in your organization:

    - **Engineering** — Incident Editor, Integration Viewer
    - **Support** — Incident Viewer, User Viewer
    - **Management** — Full Viewer access
    - **DevOps** — Incident Admin, Schedule Admin

    New hires just need to be added to their team's group.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="On-Call Rotation">
    Create an "On-Call" group with elevated incident permissions:

    - Add whoever is currently on-call
    - Remove them when their rotation ends
    - Permissions automatically adjust
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Project Teams">
    Create temporary groups for project work:

    - **Project Alpha Team** — Specific permissions for the project
    - Add cross-functional team members
    - Delete the group when the project ends
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="External Contractors">
    Create a limited-access group for contractors:

    - **Contractors** — Read-only access to specific areas
    - Easy to audit who has external access
    - Quickly revoke all contractor access if needed
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Name Groups by Function">
    Use clear, descriptive names that indicate the group's purpose:

    **Good:** "Engineering Team", "On-Call Responders", "Support Tier 1"

    **Avoid:** "Group 1", "Admins", "Users"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Document Group Purpose">
    Use the description field to explain:
    - What the group is for
    - What permissions members get
    - Who should be added
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Prefer Groups Over Direct Roles">
    Assign roles to groups rather than individual users when possible. This makes access management much easier as your team grows.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Keep Groups Focused">
    Each group should have a clear purpose. If a group needs very different permissions for different members, consider splitting it into multiple groups.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review Membership Regularly">
    Periodically audit group membership:
    - Remove people who've left or changed roles
    - Verify new team members are in the right groups
    - Check for users in groups they shouldn't be in
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Meaningful Group Keys">
    The group key is permanent, so choose wisely:
    - Use lowercase letters and underscores
    - Make it descriptive but concise
    - Examples: `engineering`, `support_tier_1`, `on_call`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Groups vs. Direct Role Assignment

| Factor | Groups | Direct Roles |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **Best for** | Teams, consistent access | Individual exceptions |
| **Onboarding** | Add to group(s) | Assign each role |
| **Offboarding** | Remove from group(s) | Remove each role |
| **Changes** | Update once, affects all | Update each user |
| **Auditing** | Easy to see who's in what team | Must check each user |
| **Flexibility** | Same permissions for all members | Individual customization |

<Tip>
  Use groups for standard team access and direct roles for individual exceptions or elevated permissions.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="User doesn't have expected permissions">
    1. Verify the user is in the correct group(s)
    2. Check that the group has the expected roles assigned
    3. Confirm the roles include the needed permissions
    4. Ensure the user's account is active
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't add a user to a group">
    1. Verify the user exists in your organization
    2. Check if they're already in the group (they won't appear in search)
    3. Ensure you have permission to manage groups
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Removed user still has access">
    1. Check if they have the same role assigned directly
    2. Check if they're in another group with the same role
    3. Ask them to log out and back in to refresh their session
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Group role changes not taking effect">
    Members may need to refresh their session. Changes are immediate but cached sessions may show old permissions until refreshed.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
