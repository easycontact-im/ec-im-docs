## Overview

The Users page is your central hub for managing everyone who interacts with your incident management system. Whether they're responders who need full access or stakeholders who only need to receive notifications, you can configure exactly how each person participates in your incident workflow.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Full Users" icon="user-check">
    Team members who can log in, respond to incidents, and manage the platform
  </Card>
  <Card title="Contacts" icon="bell">
    Stakeholders who receive notifications but don't need login access

  <Card title="High Urgency" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Critical incidents that require immediate attention. Typically configured
    with no delay and multiple notification channels.

    and fewer channels.

## Role Management

Roles define what actions a user can perform within the platform.

### Assigning Roles

1. Edit the user's profile
2. In the **Roles** section, check the roles you want to assign
3. Save your changes

<Warning>
  Removing all roles from a user will restrict their access to basic read-only
  functionality.
</Warning>

### Multiple Roles

Users can have multiple roles assigned simultaneously. Their effective permissions are the **union** of all assigned role permissions.

---

## Security Features

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Administrators can manage 2FA settings for users:

- **Enable 2FA** — Require the user to set up an authenticator app
- **Disable 2FA** — Remove the 2FA requirement (use with caution)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select User">
    Find the user in the list and click the menu (⋮)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manage 2FA">Select **Manage 2FA** from the dropdown</Step>
  <Step title="Toggle Setting">Enable or disable the 2FA requirement</Step>
</Steps>

### Password Reset

If a user is locked out or needs a new password:

1. Click the user's menu (⋮)
2. Select **Reset Password**
3. Choose to either:
   - Send a reset email to the user
   - Generate a temporary password to share manually

<Note>Temporary passwords must be changed on the user's next login.</Note>

## Deactivating Users

Instead of deleting users, you can deactivate them to preserve historical data.

### To Deactivate a User:

1. Edit the user's profile
2. Uncheck the **Active** toggle
3. Save changes

**Deactivated users:**

- Cannot log in
- Won't receive notifications
- Are preserved in incident history
- Can be reactivated at any time

### To Remove a User Completely:

1. Click the user's menu (⋮)
2. Select **Remove User**
3. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
  Removing a user is permanent. Consider deactivating instead to maintain audit
  trails.
</Warning>

## Filtering and Search

### Search

Use the search bar to find users by:

- Name
- Email address

### Filter by Type

Use the filter dropdown to show:

- **All Users** — Everyone in your organization
- **Full Users** — Only users with login access
- **Contacts Only** — Only notification-only users

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with Contacts for Stakeholders">
    For executives, managers, or external parties who only need visibility,
    create them as Contacts. You can always upgrade them to Full Users later if
    needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Configure Notification Preferences Early">
    Set up notification rules during user creation to ensure they receive alerts
    through their preferred channels from day one.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Role-Based Access">
    Assign the minimum necessary roles to each user. This follows the principle
    of least privilege and keeps your organization secure.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Require 2FA for Critical Roles">
    Enable two-factor authentication for administrators and users with elevated
    permissions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Regular Access Reviews">
    Periodically review your user list and deactivate accounts that are no
    longer needed.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
