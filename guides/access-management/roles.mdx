## Overview

Roles are the foundation of access control in EasyContact. Each role contains a set of permissions that determine what actions users can perform. You can use built-in system roles or create custom roles tailored to your organization's needs.

## Viewing Roles

The Roles page displays all available roles with key information:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Role** | Role name and unique key identifier |
| **Description** | Brief explanation of the role's purpose |
| **Scope** | Whether the role is tenant or platform scoped |
| **Type** | System (locked) or Custom (editable) |
| **Actions** | View permissions, edit, or delete |

### Viewing Role Permissions

To see what permissions a role grants:

1. Find the role in the list
2. Click the **three-dot menu** (⋮)
3. Select **View Permissions**

The dialog shows all permissions organized by category, making it easy to understand what access the role provides.

<Tip>
  Wildcard permissions (like `incidents:*:*`) are highlighted with an amber indicator, showing they grant broad access to an entire category.
</Tip>

## Understanding Permissions

Permissions control specific actions within the platform. They follow a structured format:

```
service:resource:action
```

### Permission Categories

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Incidents">
    Control access to incident management features.

    | Permission | Description |
    |------------|-------------|
    | `incident:read` | View incidents and their details |
    | `incident:write` | Create and update incidents |
    | `incident:delete` | Delete incidents |
    | `incident:acknowledge` | Acknowledge incident alerts |
    | `incident:resolve` | Mark incidents as resolved |
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Users & Access (IAM)">
    Control access to user and access management.

    | Permission | Description |
    |------------|-------------|
    | `user:read` | View user information |
    | `user:write` | Add and edit users |
    | `user:delete` | Remove users |

    | `integration:delete` | Remove integrations |
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Wildcard Permissions

Wildcards allow granting broad access without selecting individual permissions:

| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `incident:*` | All incident permissions |
| `*:read` | Read access to everything |
| `*:*` | Full access to everything |

<Info>
  Use wildcards carefully. They grant extensive access and should only be assigned to trusted roles.
</Info>

## Editing Custom Roles

To modify an existing custom role:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the Role">
    Locate the custom role in the list (look for the "Custom" badge)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Edit Dialog">
    Click the **three-dot menu** (⋮) and select **Edit**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make Changes">
    Update the role name, description, or permissions as needed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Click **Save Changes** to apply your modifications
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  System roles cannot be edited. If you need different permissions, create a custom role instead.
</Note>

---

## Deleting Custom Roles

Before deleting a role, ensure no users or groups are using it.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Usage">
    Review which users and groups have this role assigned
  </Step>
  <Step title="Remove Assignments">
    Reassign users and groups to different roles if needed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delete the Role">
    Click the **three-dot menu** (⋮) and select **Delete**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Deletion">
    Click **Delete** in the confirmation dialog
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  If the role is still assigned to users or groups, you'll see an error message listing the assignments that need to be removed first.
</Warning>

---

## Assigning Roles

Roles can be assigned in two ways:

### Direct Assignment

Assign roles directly to individual users:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Users**
2. Edit the user's profile
3. Select the roles in the **Roles** section
4. Save changes

### Group Assignment

Assign roles to groups for bulk access control:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Groups**
2. Edit the group or create a new one
3. Select the roles to assign
4. All group members automatically inherit these roles

<Tip>
  Group-based role assignment is recommended for teams. When someone joins the group, they automatically get the right permissions.
</Tip>

---

## How Permissions Work Together

When a user has multiple roles (directly or through groups), their effective permissions are the **union** of all role permissions.

<Accordion title="Example: Combined Permissions">
  **User: Sarah**

  Direct Roles:
  - Incident Viewer (`incident:read`)

  Group Membership:
  - Engineering Team → Incident Editor (`incident:read`, `incident:write`)

  **Effective Permissions:**
  - `incident:read` ✓
  - `incident:write` ✓

  Sarah can both view AND edit incidents because her permissions combine.
</Accordion>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Follow Least Privilege">
    Give users only the permissions they need. Start with minimal access and add permissions as required rather than starting with full access and restricting.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Groups for Team Access">
    Instead of assigning roles to each user individually, create groups for teams and assign roles to the group. This makes onboarding and offboarding much easier.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Create Meaningful Role Names">
    Use descriptive names that indicate the role's purpose, like "Support Team Lead" rather than "Role 1". Include the team or function in the name.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Document Custom Roles">
    Use the description field to explain why the role was created and what it's intended for. This helps future administrators understand the access model.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review Roles Periodically">
    Audit your custom roles regularly. Remove unused roles and verify that permission assignments still match your organization's needs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Avoid Wildcard Overuse">
    Wildcard permissions are convenient but can grant more access than intended. Use specific permissions when possible.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="User can't access a feature they should have">
    1. Check if the user has the correct role assigned
    2. Verify the role includes the necessary permission
    3. Check if the user is in a group with the role
    4. Ensure the user's account is active
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't edit or delete a role">
    System roles cannot be modified. Look for the "System" badge next to the role. If you need different permissions, create a new custom role.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't delete a custom role">
    The role is still assigned to users or groups. Remove all assignments first, then try deleting again. The error message will list which users/groups need to be updated.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Permission changes aren't taking effect">
    Users may need to refresh their session. Ask them to log out and back in to pick up the new permissions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
