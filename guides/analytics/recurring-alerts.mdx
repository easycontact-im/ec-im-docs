## Summary Statistics

Four metrics provide an overview of recurring alert patterns:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Unique Alerts** | Number of distinct alert types |
| **Total Occurrences** | Sum of all alert instances |
| **Increasing Trend** | Alerts getting worse over time |
| **Avg Alert Share** | Average percentage of total each alert represents |

<Info>
  High "Increasing Trend" count indicates growing problems that need attention.
</Info>

---

## Alert List Table

The main table displays detailed information about each recurring alert:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **#** | Rank by occurrence count |
| **Alert Title** | Alert name and associated service |
| **Count** | Number of times alert fired |
| **Trend** | Increasing, stable, or decreasing |
| **Volume** | Percentage of total alerts |
| **MTTA** | Average acknowledgment time |
| **MTTR** | Average resolution time |
| **Severities** | Breakdown by severity level |
| **Actions** | Quick action menu |

### Understanding Trends

| Trend | Icon | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Increasing** | 🔴 ↑ | Alert firing more frequently |
| **Stable** | ➖ | No significant change |
| **Decreasing** | 🟢 ↓ | Alert firing less frequently |

<Warning>
  Alerts with **Increasing** trends require investigation—they often indicate growing underlying problems.
</Warning>

## Filtering and Search

### Search

Search across multiple fields:
- Alert title
- Service name
- Host names
- Custom tags

### Trend Filter

Filter to see only:
- **All Trends** — Show everything
- **Increasing** — Alerts getting worse
- **Stable** — Consistent alerts
- **Decreasing** — Improving alerts

### Group by Service

Toggle "Group by Service" to aggregate alerts by service:

| Mode | Use Case |
|------|----------|

| **On** | Identify noisy services overall |

<Tip>
  Use "Group by Service" to find services that need comprehensive alert review.
</Tip>

## Identifying Tuning Candidates

### High-Priority Candidates

Alerts that should be reviewed first:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="High Volume, Low Severity">
    **Pattern:** Alert fires frequently but is mostly low/medium severity

    **Action Options:**
    - Increase threshold to reduce triggers
    - Convert to informational alert
    - Suppress during non-business hours
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Increasing Trend">
    **Pattern:** Alert firing more frequently over time

    **Action Options:**
    - Investigate root cause of increase
    - Fix underlying issue
    - Temporarily suppress while fixing
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="High MTTR Alerts">
    **Pattern:** Alert takes long time to resolve

    **Action Options:**
    - Create or improve runbook
    - Automate remediation
    - Review if alert is actionable
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Auto-Resolved Alerts">
    **Pattern:** Alert fires and resolves quickly without action

    **Action Options:**
    - Increase alert delay/threshold
    - Convert to warning level
    - Implement hysteresis
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Creating Effective Suppress Rules

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Pattern">
    Determine what makes this alert non-actionable:
    - Specific time windows?
    - Certain environments?
    - Below specific threshold?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Conditions">
    Create precise conditions that match:
    - Alert title patterns
    - Source/service
    - Severity level
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Appropriate Action">
    Choose the right response:
    - **Suppress** — Don't create incident
    - **Reduce Severity** — Lower priority
    - **Route Differently** — Send to different team
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor Results">
    After implementing, verify:
    - Desired alerts are suppressed
    - Important alerts still come through
    - Overall noise reduced
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Regular Review Cadence">
    Schedule weekly or bi-weekly reviews of recurring alerts:
    - Monday morning review of previous week
    - Include in team standup agenda
    - Track progress on noise reduction
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Start with Top 10">
    Focus on the top 10 recurring alerts:
    - These represent most of the noise
    - Improvements have biggest impact
    - More manageable scope
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Document Decisions">
    For each reviewed alert, document:
    - Decision made (tune, suppress, keep as-is)
    - Reasoning
    - Expected outcome
    - Review date
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Measure Improvement">
    Track metrics over time:
    - Total unique alerts
    - Total occurrences
    - Percentage of alerts suppressed
    - Team feedback on noise levels
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Don't Over-Suppress">
    Before suppressing, ask:
    - Has this alert ever caught a real issue?
    - Could we miss something important?
    - Is there a better alternative (tuning vs. suppressing)?
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review Suppressions Periodically">
    Suppressions can become stale:
    - Services change
    - Thresholds should be reconsidered
    - Set reminders to review suppression rules quarterly
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Patterns and Solutions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Disk Space Alerts">
    **Pattern:** Frequent disk space warnings that self-resolve

    **Solutions:**
    - Increase threshold (e.g., 80% → 90%)
    - Implement auto-cleanup scripts
    - Add hysteresis (alert only after X minutes)
    - Separate critical partition alerts from non-critical
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Connection Pool Alerts">
    **Pattern:** Brief spikes in connection pool usage

    **Solutions:**
    - Increase pool size if appropriate
    - Add averaging/smoothing to alert
    - Alert on sustained high usage, not spikes
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Batch Job Failures">
    **Pattern:** Same job fails and succeeds on retry

    **Solutions:**
    - Improve job retry logic
    - Alert only after N failures
    - Separate transient vs. persistent failures
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Health Check Flapping">
    **Pattern:** Health checks failing/recovering rapidly

    **Solutions:**
    - Add dead time between alerts
    - Require multiple consecutive failures
    - Review health check timeout settings
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Deployment Noise">
    **Pattern:** Alerts during deployments

    **Solutions:**
    - Implement deployment windows with suppression
    - Use canary/gradual deployments
    - Improve deployment health checks
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Pagination and Large Datasets

For organizations with many alerts:

### Pagination Controls

- **Rows per page:** 10, 25, 50, or 100
- **Navigation:** Previous/Next page buttons
- **Position indicator:** "1-25 of 150"

### Working with Large Lists

<Tips>
  - Use search and filters to narrow down
  - Export to CSV for offline analysis
  - Focus on top performers by incident count
  - Use "Group by Service" to aggregate
</Tips>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No alerts appearing">
    - Verify incidents exist in the selected date range
    - Check that incidents have title information
    - Ensure incidents are assigned to your tenant
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Trend data seems wrong">
    - Trends compare current period to previous period
    - Short date ranges may show variable trends
    - Try longer date range for more accurate trends
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Service grouping not working">
    - Verify incidents have service metadata
    - Check integration is sending service information
    - Review alert payload configuration
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Export not including all data">
    - Exports include current filter results
    - Clear filters to export all data
    - Maximum export is 100 alerts
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Email report not received">
    - Check spam/junk folders
    - Verify email address in profile
    - Contact admin if email delivery issues persist
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
