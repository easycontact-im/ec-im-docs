## Overview

Postmortems (Post-Incident Reviews) enable your team to analyze resolved incidents, identify root causes, and create action items to prevent similar incidents in the future. With a blameless approach, rich editing capabilities, and comprehensive tracking, you can build a culture of continuous improvement.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Conduct Blameless Reviews">
    Focus on systems and processes, not individuals. Ask "How did the system allow this?" rather than "Who caused this?"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Complete Postmortems Promptly">
    Aim to complete postmortems within 5-7 days while details are fresh. Set a calendar reminder after resolving major incidents.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Build Comprehensive Timelines">
    Include all significant events, not just the obvious ones. Detection, communication, and decision points are often as important as technical actions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Multiple Root Cause Categories">
    Most incidents have contributing factors across multiple categories. A technical bug might be enabled by a process gap.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Create Specific Action Items">
    "Improve monitoring" is too vague. "Add alert for database connection pool exhaustion" is actionable and measurable.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Assign Owners and Due Dates">
    Action items without owners don't get done. Set realistic due dates and follow up regularly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Share Learnings Broadly">
    Publish postmortems to the whole team. Others can learn from incidents they weren't involved in.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review Historical Postmortems">
    Periodically review past postmortems. Are similar incidents recurring? Are action items being completed?
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## Common Patterns

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Production Outage">
    **Timeline Focus:** Detection time, escalation path, mitigation steps

    **Root Causes:** Often technical + process (e.g., config change without review)

    **Action Items:** Improved monitoring, rollback procedures, change management
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Performance Degradation">
    **Timeline Focus:** When degradation started, customer impact, resolution

    **Root Causes:** Capacity planning, load testing gaps, monitoring blindspots

    **Action Items:** Capacity alerts, load testing, performance baselines
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Security Incident">
    **Timeline Focus:** Initial compromise, detection, containment, remediation

    **Root Causes:** Vulnerability, access control, detection gaps

    **Action Items:** Patching, access review, security monitoring
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Data Loss/Corruption">
    **Timeline Focus:** When issue occurred, detection, data recovery

    **Root Causes:** Backup gaps, validation missing, process failures

    **Action Items:** Backup verification, data validation, recovery testing
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't find incidents to link">
    - Verify you're searching with at least 2 characters
    - Check incident exists and is visible to your tenant
    - Try searching by incident number (e.g., "123")
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="PDF export shows blank text">
    - Clear browser cache and retry
    - Try a different browser
    - Ensure postmortem has content to export
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't edit published postmortem">
    Published postmortems are read-only. Contact an admin if corrections are needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Action items not saving">
    - Ensure required fields (Title) are filled
    - Check for validation errors
    - Save postmortem before adding action items
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Contributors not appearing">
    - Verify user exists in the tenant
    - Check user has appropriate permissions
    - Try searching by email if name doesn't work
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
