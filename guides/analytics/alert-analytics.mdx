## Overview

The Alert Analytics page provides deep insights into your incident patterns. Identify when incidents occur, analyze response time distributions, and discover which alert sources generate the most noise.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Incident Heatmap" icon="grip">

  </Card>
  <Card title="Response Distributions" icon="chart-bar">
    Understand MTTA and MTTR patterns
  </Card>
  <Card title="Top Sources" icon="database">

## Key Metrics

The page displays four primary metrics:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total Incidents** | Total incidents in the period with change percentage |
| **MTTA** | Mean Time to Acknowledge with trend indicator |
| **MTTR** | Mean Time to Resolve with trend indicator |
| **Escalation Rate** | Percentage of incidents requiring escalation |

---

## Incident Heatmap

The heatmap visualizes incident frequency by day of week and hour:

### Reading the Heatmap

| Color | Incident Level |
|-------|----------------|
| Gray | No incidents |
| Light Green | Low (< 25% of max) |
| Amber | Moderate (25-50% of max) |
| Orange | High (50-75% of max) |
| Red | Very High (> 75% of max) |

### What to Look For

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Peak Hours">
    Identify when most incidents occur. Common patterns:
    - Business hours spikes (user-driven issues)
    - Off-hours spikes (batch jobs, maintenance windows)
    - Early morning (overnight job failures)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Day Patterns">
    - Monday spikes may indicate weekend accumulation
    - Friday afternoon spikes may suggest deployment issues
    - Weekend patterns show after-hours coverage needs
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scheduling Insights">
    Use heatmap data to:
    - Optimize on-call schedules for high-incident periods
    - Schedule maintenance during quiet hours
    - Plan deployments to avoid peak incident times
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  Hover over any cell to see the exact incident count for that day and hour.

## MTTA Distribution

The MTTA (Mean Time to Acknowledge) distribution chart shows how long it takes to acknowledge incidents:

| Bucket | Performance |
|--------|-------------|
| 0-2 min | Excellent |
| 2-5 min | Good |
| 5-15 min | Acceptable |
| 15-30 min | Needs improvement |
| 30+ min | Critical - review alerting |

### Key Statistics

- **Average** — Mean acknowledgment time
- **P95** — 95th percentile (95% of incidents acknowledged faster than this)

<Info>
  A high P95 with low average suggests occasional slow responses. Check for patterns in those slow acknowledgments.
</Info>

## MTTR Distribution

The MTTR (Mean Time to Resolve) distribution shows resolution time patterns:

| Bucket | Typical Severity |
|--------|------------------|
| 0-30 min | Quick fixes, auto-resolved |
| 30-60 min | Standard incidents |
| 1-4 hours | Complex issues |
| 4-24 hours | Major incidents |
| 24+ hours | Extended outages |

### Analyzing MTTR

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Bimodal Distribution">
    Two peaks (e.g., 15 min and 4 hours) often indicate:
    - Quick-fix incidents vs. complex investigations
    - Different severity levels requiring different effort
    - Opportunity to improve runbooks for the longer category
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Long Tail">
    A long tail of high-MTTR incidents may indicate:
    - Missing documentation for complex issues
    - Need for escalation path improvements
    - Knowledge gaps in the on-call team
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tight Distribution">
    Most incidents resolving in similar time suggests:
    - Well-defined playbooks
    - Consistent incident complexity
    - Effective knowledge sharing
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Top Alert Sources

This section ranks alert sources by incident volume:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Rank** | Position by incident count |
| **Source** | Alert source/integration name |
| **Count** | Number of incidents |
| **Percent** | Share of total incidents |

### Using This Data

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Noisy Sources">
    Sources generating > 20% of alerts may need tuning
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Alert Quality">
    High-volume, low-severity sources are candidates for:
    - Alert threshold adjustment
    - Suppression rules
    - Consolidation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Balance Coverage">
    Ensure critical services have adequate alerting relative to their importance
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Top Recurring Alerts

This table shows the most frequently triggered alerts:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Alert Title** | The alert name and service |
| **Count** | Number of occurrences |
| **Trend** | Increasing, stable, or decreasing |
| **Volume** | Percentage of total alerts |
| **MTTA/MTTR** | Average response times for this alert |
| **Severities** | Breakdown by severity level |

### Group by Service Toggle

Enable "Group by Service" to aggregate alerts by service, useful for:
- Identifying services generating the most alerts
- Service-level noise analysis
- Capacity planning

### Taking Action

From the recurring alerts view, you can:

1. **View Incidents** — Filter incident list to this alert
2. **Create Suppress Rule** — Set up an alert rule to reduce noise

<Warning>
  Before suppressing alerts, ensure they're truly noise and not indicators of underlying issues.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Weekly Alert Review">
    Schedule weekly reviews of top recurring alerts to identify tuning opportunities.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Set MTTA/MTTR Targets">
    Establish targets based on severity:
    - Critical: MTTA < 5 min, MTTR < 1 hour
    - High: MTTA < 10 min, MTTR < 4 hours
    - Medium: MTTA < 30 min, MTTR < 24 hours
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Heatmap for Scheduling">
    Align on-call schedules with peak incident hours identified in the heatmap.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Address Increasing Trends">
    Alerts with increasing trends should be investigated—they often indicate growing problems.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Document Alert Sources">
    Maintain documentation for each major alert source including expected volume and response procedures.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Heatmap shows no data">
    - Verify incidents exist in the selected date range
    - Check that incidents have proper timestamps
    - Ensure incidents are assigned to your tenant
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="MTTA shows as 0">
    - Incidents may be auto-acknowledged
    - Check if acknowledgment is being recorded properly
    - Review integration configurations
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Top sources list is empty">
    - Verify incidents have source information
    - Check integration is properly configured to send source data
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
