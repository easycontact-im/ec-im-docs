## Overview

The On-Call Analytics page helps you understand and balance the on-call burden across your team. Track who handles the most incidents, identify after-hours and weekend load, and ensure no individual is overwhelmed.

## Summary Statistics

Five key metrics provide an overview of on-call load:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **On-Call Engineers** | Number of responders who handled incidents |
| **Total Incidents** | Total incidents handled by all responders |
| **After Hours** | Incidents outside business hours (6pm-8am) |
| **Night Incidents** | Incidents during night hours (10pm-6am) |
| **Weekend Incidents** | Incidents on Saturday and Sunday |

<Info>
  After-hours and night incidents contribute more heavily to burden scores as they're more disruptive to work-life balance.
</Info>

## Incident Distribution Chart

The bar chart shows how incidents are distributed among responders:

### Reading the Chart

- **Taller bars** indicate responders handling more incidents
- First names are shown for readability
- Top 10 responders are displayed

### Ideal Distribution

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Balanced">
    Relatively even bars across responders indicates:
    - Fair on-call rotation
    - Good coverage distribution
    - Healthy team dynamics
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Unbalanced">
    Large disparities may indicate:
    - Schedule gaps being filled by certain individuals
    - Skill-based routing concentrating incidents
    - Need to adjust rotation schedules
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Burden Score

Each responder receives a **Burden Score** (0-100) that factors in:

| Factor | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Total Incidents | Base | Raw incident count |
| After-Hours | 1.5x | Incidents outside 8am-6pm |
| Night Incidents | 2x | Incidents between 10pm-6am |
| Weekend Incidents | 1.5x | Saturday and Sunday incidents |

### Burden Levels

| Score | Level | Indicator |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| 0-49 | Low | 🟢 Green |
| 50-79 | Medium | 🟡 Amber |
| 80-100 | High | 🔴 Red |

<Warning>
  Responders with **High** burden scores are at risk of burnout. Take immediate action to redistribute workload.
</Warning>

## Engineer Burden Cards

Each responder has a detailed card showing:

### Card Layout

| Section | Information |
|---------|-------------|
| **Header** | Name, email, rank, and burden level badge |
| **Progress Bar** | Visual burden score indicator |
| **Metrics Grid** | Total, After Hours, Night, and Weekend counts |

### Using the Cards

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Rankings">
    Cards are ordered by burden score (highest first)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Identify High Burden">
    Look for red "High" badges indicating overloaded responders
  </Step>
  <Step title="Compare Metrics">
    Check if high burden comes from total volume or after-hours work
  </Step>
  <Step title="Take Action">
    Adjust schedules, add coverage, or redistribute responsibilities
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing On-Call Burden

### Identifying Problems

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Single Responder High Burden">
    **Signs:**
    - One person with score 80+ while others are under 50
    - Consistently handling most after-hours incidents

    **Causes:**
    - Unfair schedule rotation
    - Being the "go-to" person for certain issues
    - Coverage gaps during specific shifts

    **Solutions:**
    - Review and adjust rotation schedule
    - Cross-train team members
    - Add backup on-call coverage
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="High After-Hours Load">
    **Signs:**
    - After-hours count approaching or exceeding business-hours count
    - Night incidents are common

    **Causes:**
    - Batch jobs or scheduled tasks failing
    - Serving global customers
    - Infrastructure issues manifesting overnight

    **Solutions:**
    - Review timing of batch jobs
    - Implement better monitoring before failure
    - Consider follow-the-sun coverage
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Weekend Concentration">
    **Signs:**
    - High weekend incident count
    - Same people always handling weekend work

    **Causes:**
    - Deployment patterns (Friday deploys)
    - Reduced monitoring attention
    - Scheduled maintenance issues

    **Solutions:**
    - Avoid Friday deployments
    - Rotate weekend on-call fairly
    - Automate weekend monitoring
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Taking Action

<Steps>
  <Step title="Analyze the Data">
    Understand where burden is coming from (total volume vs. timing)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Discuss with Team">
    Have an open conversation about workload and preferences
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adjust Schedules">
    Modify on-call rotations to distribute load more evenly
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor Results">
    Track burden scores over time to verify improvements
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Regular Reviews">
    Review on-call analytics at least monthly. Burden can accumulate without obvious signs until burnout occurs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Fair Rotations">
    Ensure everyone takes turns with undesirable shifts (nights, weekends, holidays). Use the data to verify fairness.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Compensatory Time">
    When someone handles a high-burden period, consider:
    - Extra time off
    - Reduced on-call in following weeks
    - Other recognition
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Team Size">
    Maintain adequate team size for sustainable on-call. Generally, minimum 4-5 people for 24/7 coverage.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reduce Total Incidents">
    The best way to reduce burden is to reduce incidents:
    - Fix recurring issues
    - Tune noisy alerts
    - Improve service reliability
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Follow-the-Sun">
    For global teams, route incidents to responders in their business hours when possible.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Comparing Time Periods

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Baseline Period">
    Use date selector to view a previous period (e.g., last 30 days)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Note Key Metrics">
    Record burden scores and distribution
  </Step>
  <Step title="Compare to Current">
    Switch to current period and compare
  </Step>
  <Step title="Identify Trends">
    - Is overall burden increasing or decreasing?
    - Are the same people consistently high burden?
    - Has distribution improved after schedule changes?
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No data appearing">
    - Verify incidents exist in the selected date range
    - Check that incidents have assignees
    - Ensure responders are properly configured in the system
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Burden scores seem wrong">
    - Verify incident timestamps are correct
    - Check timezone settings
    - Review how after-hours/night/weekend are defined for your org
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Missing responders">
    - Check if they handled any incidents in the period
    - Verify they're members of active teams
    - Ensure incidents are properly attributed to them
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="After-hours counts seem high">
    - Review your organization's business hours definition
    - Consider timezone of incident vs. responder
    - Check for systematic issues (e.g., batch job failures)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
