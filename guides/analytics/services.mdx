## Overview

The Service Health page provides visibility into the reliability of your services. Track health scores, uptime percentages, and incident patterns for each service to identify areas needing attention.

## Summary Statistics

Four metrics provide an overview of service health:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Avg Health Score** | Average health score across all services |
| **Healthy Services** | Services with health score ≥ 80 |
| **Degraded Services** | Services with health score 50-79 |
| **Critical Services** | Services with health score < 50 |

---

## Health Score Calculation

The health score (0-100) combines multiple factors:

| Factor | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Uptime | 40% | Percentage of time without incidents |
| Incident Count | 30% | Lower is better |
| MTTR | 20% | Faster resolution improves score |
| Severity Mix | 10% | Critical incidents have more impact |

### Health Status Levels

| Status | Score Range | Badge Color | Meaning |
|--------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Healthy** | 80-100 | 🟢 Green | Service is performing well |
| **Degraded** | 50-79 | 🟡 Amber | Service needs attention |
| **Critical** | 0-49 | 🔴 Red | Service requires immediate action |

---

## Service Cards

Each service displays a detailed card with:

### Card Information

| Section | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Header** | Service name and health status badge |
| **Health Score** | Visual progress bar with numeric score |
| **Metrics** | Uptime %, Incident count, Average MTTR |

### Understanding the Metrics

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Health Score">
    The overall reliability indicator:
    - **90-100** — Excellent reliability
    - **80-89** — Good, minor issues
    - **70-79** — Degraded, needs attention
    - **50-69** — Significant problems
    - **< 50** — Critical, requires immediate action
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Uptime">
    Percentage of time without active incidents:
    - **99.9%+** — High availability target met
    - **99-99.9%** — Generally reliable
    - **95-99%** — Room for improvement
    - **< 95%** — Significant reliability issues
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Incident Count">
    Total incidents for this service in the period:
    - Compare to similar services
    - Track trends over time
    - High counts may indicate systemic issues
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Avg MTTR">
    Average time to resolve incidents for this service:
    - Shorter is better
    - Compare to organization average
    - Long MTTR may indicate complexity or knowledge gaps
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Using Service Health Data

### Prioritizing Improvements

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Critical Services">
    Start with any services showing "Critical" status
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Degraded Services">
    Plan improvements for "Degraded" services
  </Step>
  <Step title="Investigate Root Causes">
    For unhealthy services, analyze:
    - Recurring incident patterns
    - Common failure modes
    - Resource constraints
  </Step>
  <Step title="Track Improvement">
    Monitor health scores over time to verify fixes
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Comparing Services

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Similar Services">
    Compare services with similar functions:
    - Why does API Service A have 95% uptime while API Service B has 99%?
    - What practices from healthy services can be adopted?
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Critical Path Services">
    Pay extra attention to services that:
    - Support revenue-generating features
    - Are dependencies for many other services
    - Have external SLA commitments
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="New vs. Established">
    New services may naturally have lower scores:
    - Track improvement trajectory
    - Ensure adequate monitoring is in place
    - Document expected stabilization timeline
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Set Service-Level Targets">
    Establish health score targets based on service criticality:
    - Customer-facing critical: 95+
    - Internal critical: 90+
    - Non-critical: 80+
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Regular Health Reviews">
    Include service health in:
    - Weekly team standups
    - Monthly reliability reviews
    - Quarterly planning
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Track Trends">
    A service improving from 60 to 75 is progress, even if not yet "healthy."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Investigate Sudden Drops">
    If a healthy service suddenly becomes degraded:
    - Check for recent deployments
    - Review infrastructure changes
    - Look for external factors (dependencies, traffic)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Balance Investment">
    Don't over-invest in already-healthy services. Focus improvement effort on degraded and critical services.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Document Service Context">
    Maintain documentation explaining:
    - Expected health baselines
    - Known limitations
    - Improvement roadmaps
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Service not appearing">
    - Verify incidents exist with this service name
    - Check service tagging in integrations
    - Ensure consistent service naming across alerts
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Health score seems incorrect">
    - Review incident data for the service
    - Check if all incidents are properly attributed
    - Verify the calculation period matches expectations
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Uptime shows 100% despite incidents">
    - Check if incident durations are being recorded
    - Verify resolution times are being set
    - Review how uptime is calculated for your setup
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Too many services listed">
    - Review alert naming conventions
    - Consolidate similar service names
    - Consider service grouping strategies
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Service Naming Best Practices

Consistent service naming improves analytics accuracy:

| Pattern | Example | Benefit |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Environment prefix | `prod-api`, `staging-api` | Separate production metrics |
| Team ownership | `payments-gateway` | Easy team attribution |
| Functional grouping | `auth-service`, `auth-cache` | Group related services |

<Tip>
  Establish service naming conventions and document them. Inconsistent naming creates fragmented analytics.
