## Overview

The Team Performance page enables you to compare how different teams handle incidents. Identify high-performing teams, spot teams that may need support, and ensure balanced workload distribution across your organization.

## Summary Statistics

The dashboard shows three key summary metrics:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Active Teams** | Number of teams with incident activity |
| **Avg MTTA** | Average acknowledgment time across all teams |
| **Avg MTTR** | Average resolution time across all teams |

These provide a baseline for comparing individual team performance.

## Incidents by Team Chart

The horizontal bar chart ranks teams by incident volume:

### Reading the Chart

- **Longer bars** indicate teams handling more incidents
- Teams are sorted by incident count (highest first)
- Top 10 teams are shown by default

### What to Look For

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Unbalanced Workload">
    If one team handles significantly more incidents:
    - Verify it's appropriate for their service scope
    - Consider if alert tuning is needed
    - Evaluate if team needs more resources
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Low Activity Teams">
    Teams with very few incidents may indicate:
    - Well-maintained services
    - Missing alert coverage
    - Incidents being routed elsewhere
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Comparison Points">
    Compare teams with similar responsibilities to identify:
    - Best practices to share
    - Training opportunities
    - Process improvements
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Team Comparison Table

The detailed table shows comprehensive metrics for each team:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Team** | Team name |
| **Incidents** | Total incidents handled |
| **Avg MTTA** | Average time to acknowledge |
| **Avg MTTR** | Average time to resolve |
| **Escalation Rate** | Percentage of incidents escalated |
| **Ack Rate** | Percentage of incidents acknowledged |

### Understanding the Metrics

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="MTTA">
    **Mean Time to Acknowledge** measures how quickly a team responds to new incidents.

    - **< 5 min** — Excellent
    - **5-15 min** — Good
    - **15-30 min** — Acceptable
    - **> 30 min** — Needs improvement

    Low MTTA indicates effective alerting and available responders.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="MTTR">
    **Mean Time to Resolve** measures how quickly a team fixes incidents.

    - **< 30 min** — Excellent (for non-critical)
    - **30 min - 2 hours** — Good
    - **2-8 hours** — Acceptable for complex issues
    - **> 8 hours** — Review for improvements

    MTTR varies significantly by incident complexity and team scope.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Escalation Rate">
    **Escalation Rate** shows how often incidents require additional help.

    - **< 10%** — Team handles most issues independently
    - **10-25%** — Normal escalation level
    - **> 25%** — May indicate training needs or complex services

    Some variation is expected based on service criticality.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Acknowledgment Rate">
    **Acknowledgment Rate** shows what percentage of incidents get acknowledged.

    - **> 95%** — Excellent
    - **85-95%** — Good
    - **< 85%** — Review alerting and on-call coverage

    Low ack rates may indicate alert fatigue or coverage gaps.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Using Team Analytics

### Identifying Performance Patterns

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Overall Metrics">
    Start with the summary statistics to understand baseline performance
  </Step>
  <Step title="Identify Outliers">
    Look for teams significantly above or below average in any metric
  </Step>
  <Step title="Investigate Differences">
    For outlier teams, consider:
    - Service complexity differences
    - Team size and experience
    - Alert quality and volume
  </Step>
  <Step title="Take Action">
    - Share best practices from high-performing teams
    - Provide support to struggling teams
    - Adjust alert configurations as needed
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Comparing Similar Teams

To make fair comparisons, consider teams with:
- Similar service complexity
- Comparable incident volumes
- Similar severity distributions

<Info>
  A team handling mostly critical incidents will naturally have different metrics than one handling mostly low-severity alerts.
</Info>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review Monthly">
    Schedule monthly team performance reviews to track improvement over time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Set Team Goals">
    Establish team-specific targets based on:
    - Historical performance
    - Service criticality
    - Industry benchmarks
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Focus on Trends">
    A team's improvement over time matters more than absolute numbers. Celebrate progress.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Avoid Blame">
    Use metrics to identify improvement opportunities, not to penalize teams. High MTTR may indicate complex services, not poor performance.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Share Knowledge">
    When a team shows excellent metrics:
    - Document their practices
    - Share with other teams
    - Consider cross-team mentoring
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Consider Context">
    Always consider factors that affect metrics:
    - Team size and coverage hours
    - Service age and technical debt
    - Recent changes or deployments
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="New Team with High MTTR">
    **Situation:** A newly formed team shows higher MTTR than established teams.

    **Action:**
    - This is normal for new teams learning their services
    - Pair new members with experienced responders
    - Ensure runbooks and documentation are available
    - Track improvement over first 3-6 months
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Team with High Escalation Rate">
    **Situation:** A team escalates more than 30% of incidents.

    **Action:**
    - Review what types of incidents are escalated
    - Identify knowledge gaps for training
    - Evaluate if services should be reassigned
    - Check if escalation paths are appropriate
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Team with Low Acknowledgment Rate">
    **Situation:** A team acknowledges fewer than 85% of incidents.

    **Action:**
    - Review on-call coverage schedules
    - Check notification delivery (email, SMS, app)
    - Evaluate alert fatigue (too many low-value alerts)
    - Consider auto-escalation policies
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Team not appearing in list">
    - Verify team has incidents assigned in the selected period
    - Check that incidents are properly associated with teams
    - Ensure team is set to active status
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Metrics showing as 0 or blank">
    - Verify incidents have acknowledgment/resolution timestamps
    - Check that team members are properly assigned to incidents
    - Review date range selection
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Data seems incorrect">
    - Compare with incident list for the team
    - Check for data from recent incidents (may not be included yet)
    - Verify all team incidents are in the selected date range
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
