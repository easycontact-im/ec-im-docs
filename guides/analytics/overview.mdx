## Overview

The Analytics dashboard provides a comprehensive view of your incident management performance. Track key metrics like MTTA, MTTR, incident volume, and see who's currently on-call—all in one place.

## Key Metrics

The dashboard displays five primary metrics at the top:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total Incidents** | Total incidents in the selected period, with open count |
| **MTTA** | Mean Time to Acknowledge - average time from trigger to acknowledgment |
| **MTTR** | Mean Time to Resolve - average time from trigger to resolution |
| **Escalation Rate** | Percentage of incidents that required escalation |
| **On-Call Today** | Number of engineers currently on-call |

### Understanding Trend Indicators

Each metric shows a trend indicator comparing to the previous period:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Time Metrics (MTTA/MTTR)">
    For response time metrics, **lower is better**:
    - 🟢 **Green (↓)** — Response times are improving
    - 🔴 **Red (↑)** — Response times are getting worse
    - ➖ **Gray (−)** — No significant change
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Count Metrics">
    For incident counts and escalation rates:
    - 🟢 **Green (↓)** — Fewer incidents/escalations (positive)
    - 🟠 **Amber (↑)** — More incidents (requires attention)
    - ➖ **Gray (−)** — No significant change
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Incident Volume Chart

The stacked bar chart shows daily incident volume broken down by severity:

| Severity | Color | Typical Impact |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| **Critical** | Red | Complete service outage |
| **High** | Orange | Major functionality impaired |
| **Medium** | Yellow | Limited impact |
| **Low** | Blue | Minimal impact |

<Tip>
  Use this chart to identify patterns like increased incidents on specific days or severity spikes that may indicate systemic issues.
</Tip>

## Severity Distribution

The donut chart shows the proportion of incidents by severity level. This helps you understand:

- **Overall incident profile** — Are most incidents low severity, or dealing with many critical issues?
- **Severity trends** — Compare distributions across different time periods
- **Resource allocation** — High critical/high ratios may indicate need for more senior responders

---

## Monthly Trends

The line chart tracks two key metrics over the last 6 months:

- **Incident Count** (left axis) — Monthly incident volume
- **MTTR** (right axis) — Average resolution time

<Info>
  This long-term view helps identify whether your incident response is improving over time or if seasonal patterns exist.

### What to Look For

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Improving Trend">
    - Decreasing incident count over time
    - Decreasing MTTR with stable or increasing incidents
    - These indicate effective preventive measures and faster response
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Concerning Patterns">
    - Rising incident count month over month
    - Increasing MTTR despite stable incidents
    - Spikes that correlate with deployments or changes
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Seasonal Patterns">
    - Recurring spikes at month-end (batch processing)
    - Holiday period changes (reduced staffing)
    - Quarterly patterns (traffic increases)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Currently On-Call

The on-call section shows all engineers currently on-call, including:

- **Name** — Engineer's full name
- **Email** — Contact email
- **Team** — Associated team (if applicable)

This provides quick visibility into who's available to respond to incidents right now.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review Weekly">
    Check the analytics dashboard at least weekly during team standup or incident review meetings to track trends.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Set Baseline Targets">
    Establish target MTTA and MTTR values for your organization. Common targets:
    - MTTA: < 5 minutes
    - MTTR: < 1 hour for high severity
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Investigate Anomalies">
    When you see spikes in the incident volume chart, drill down to understand the root cause.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Compare Periods">
    Use different date ranges to compare performance: "Are we doing better this month than last month?"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
