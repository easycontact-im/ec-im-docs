## Overview

Integrations connect Easyalert to your monitoring and observability tools. When an alert fires in your monitoring system, it's sent to Easyalert via webhook, automatically creating an incident and triggering the appropriate escalation policy.

## Creating an Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Integrations">
    Go to **Integrations** page from left menu
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Add Integration">
    Click the **Add Integration** button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Source Type">
    Choose the **Source Type** that matches your monitoring tool (Zabbix, Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, or Custom)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Details">
    - **Name** — Descriptive name (e.g., "Production Prometheus", "Zabbix DC1")
    - **Description** — Optional explanation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and Copy URL">
    Click **Create** to save and copy the generated **Webhook URL**
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Each integration gets a unique webhook URL. Keep this URL secure as anyone with access can send alerts to your account.
</Info>

---

## Webhook URL Structure

Your webhook URL follows this format:

```
https://easyalert-api.easycontact.ai/api/v1/webhooks/ingest/{token}
```

> **Example:** `https://easyalert-api.easycontact.ai/api/v1/webhooks/ingest/wh_abc123...`

The `token` is a unique identifier for your integration. If compromised, you can regenerate it from the integration settings.

---

## Viewing Integrations

The Integrations page shows all your configured integrations:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Name** | Integration name and description |
| **Type** | Source type badge (Zabbix, Prometheus, etc.) |
| **Events** | Total number of events received |
| **Last Event** | When the last event was received |
| **Status** | Active or Inactive |
| **Actions** | View URL, configure, edit, delete |

### Integration Statistics

Each integration tracks:
- **Event Count** — Total alerts received
- **Last Event** — Timestamp of most recent alert
- **Last Error** — Most recent processing error (if any)
- **Consecutive Errors** — Count of sequential failures

---

## Managing Integrations

### View Webhook URL

1. Click the **three-dot menu** (⋮)
2. Select **View Webhook URL**
3. Copy the URL to your clipboard

### Regenerate Token

If your webhook URL is compromised:

1. Click the three-dot menu
2. Select **Regenerate Token**
3. Confirm the action

<Warning>
  Regenerating the token invalidates the old URL immediately. Update your monitoring tool configuration with the new URL.
</Warning>

### Activate/Deactivate

Toggle integration status without deleting:

1. Click the three-dot menu
2. Select **Activate** or **Deactivate**

Inactive integrations ignore incoming webhooks.

### Delete Integration

1. Click the three-dot menu
2. Select **Delete**
3. Confirm deletion

<Warning>
  Deleting an integration permanently invalidates its webhook URL and removes all configuration.
</Warning>

---

## Configuring Severity Mapping

Map source severity values to Easyalert's standard levels.

### Standard Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Color |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Critical** | Requires immediate attention, service down | Red |
| **High** | Serious issue, significant degradation | Orange |
| **Warning** | Potential issue, investigate | Yellow |
| **Info** | Informational alert, low impact | Blue |
| **OK** | Recovery/resolved state | Green |

<Info>
  Easyalert automatically maps common severity values from monitoring tools. See individual integration guides for specific mappings.
</Info>

### Setting Up Mappings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Configuration">
    Click three-dot menu → **Configure Mappings**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Source Field">
    Enter the field name your tool uses for severity (e.g., "priority", "level")
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Mappings">
    Map each source value to a standard severity:
    - "P1" → Critical
    - "P2" → High
    - "P3" → Warning
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Default">
    Choose the fallback severity for unmapped values
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Accordion title="Example: Datadog Priority Mapping">
  ```json
  {
    "sourceField": "alert_priority",
    "mappings": {
      "P1": "critical",
      "P2": "high",
      "P3": "warning",
      "P4": "info",
      "P5": "info"
    },
    "default": "warning"
  }
  ```
</Accordion>

---

## Configuring Enrichment

Add static metadata to all alerts from an integration.

### Use Cases

- Add environment tags (production, staging, dev)
- Identify the team responsible
- Add region or datacenter information
- Tag for routing rules

### Adding Enrichment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Configuration">
    Click three-dot menu → **Configure Mappings** → **Enrichment** tab
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Key-Value Pairs">
    Enter the key and value for each enrichment field
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Click **Save** to apply
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Accordion title="Example: Production Environment Enrichment">
  ```json
  {
    "enrichment": {
      "tags.environment": "production",
      "tags.team": "platform",
      "tags.region": "eu-west-1",
      "tags.tier": "critical"
    }
  }
  ```
</Accordion>

<Tip>
  Enrichment fields can be used in escalation routing rules to direct alerts to the appropriate policy.
</Tip>

---

## Tag-Based Routing

All integrations support tag-based routing for escalation policies and notification rules.

### How Tags Work

1. **From Source**: Tags come from your monitoring tool (Zabbix host tags, Prometheus labels, Datadog tags, etc.)
2. **From Enrichment**: Static tags added via integration configuration
3. **From Payload**: Custom fields in the webhook payload automatically become tags

### Routing Examples

**Escalation Routing:**
```
tags.customer equals "AcmeCorp" → Acme Corp Policy
tags.environment equals "production" → Production Policy
tags.team equals "backend" → Backend Team Policy
```

**Notification Rules:**
```
tags.severity equals "critical" → call + sms + email
tags.environment equals "staging" → email only
tags.team equals "database" → Database Team channel
```

<Info>
  See individual integration guides for specific tag configuration instructions.
</Info>

## Webhook Samples

Easyalert stores samples of incoming webhooks for debugging and configuration.

### Viewing Samples

1. Navigate to **Configuration** → **Webhook Samples**
2. Filter by integration
3. View raw and transformed payloads

### Sample Analysis

The analysis feature helps you understand:
- Which fields are present in your alerts
- Common values for key fields
- How to configure severity mappings

## Auto-Detection

Easyalert automatically detects the source type based on payload characteristics:

| Source | Detection Signals |
|--------|-------------------|
| Zabbix | `event_id`, `trigger_name`, `trigger_severity` |
| Prometheus | `alerts` array, `status: firing/resolved` |
| Grafana | `ruleId`, `orgId`, `dashboardURL` |
| Datadog | `alert_id`, `datadoghq.com` in URLs |
| Dynatrace | `PID`, `ProblemID`, `State: OPEN/RESOLVED` |
| AppDynamics | `event_type: POLICY_*`, `health_rule_name` |
| New Relic | `issueId`, `newrelic.com` in URLs |

If no specific source is detected, the **Custom** transformer handles the webhook.

## Rate Limits

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Requests per minute | 1,000 per webhook |
| Payload size | 1 MB maximum |

<Warning>
  Exceeding rate limits returns HTTP 429. Implement backoff in your monitoring tool if needed.
</Warning>
