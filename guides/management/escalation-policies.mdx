## Overview

Escalation Policies define the notification sequence when an incident occurs. They ensure the right people are contacted in the right order until someone acknowledges and takes ownership. With multi-level escalations, flexible targeting, and automatic retries, you can build robust response workflows for any scenario.

## How Escalation Works

When an incident triggers an escalation policy:

```
Incident Created
       ↓
   Level 1 → Notify targets (call, SMS, email)
       ↓
   No response within timeout?
       ↓
   Level 2 → Notify next set of targets
       ↓
   No response within timeout?
       ↓
   Level 3 → Final escalation
       ↓
   Still no response?
       ↓
   Repeat cycle (if configured)
```

The escalation stops immediately when someone **acknowledges** the incident.

## Viewing Escalation Policies

The Escalation Policies page shows all your policies:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Policy** | Name, description, and default indicator (⭐) |
| **Escalation Flow** | Preview of levels with target counts |
| **Status** | Active or Inactive |
| **Actions** | Edit, Duplicate, Delete |

### Default Policy

One policy can be marked as the **default**. This policy is used when:
- No routing rule matches the incident
- A service doesn't have a specific policy assigned

The default policy is indicated with a star icon (⭐).

## Creating Escalation Policies

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Create Dialog">
    Click the **Add Policy** button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Policy Settings">
    In the **Policy Settings** tab:
    - **Name** — Descriptive name (e.g., "Production Critical - 24/7")
    - **Description** — Explain when this policy should be used
    - **Set as Default** — Toggle if this should be the fallback policy
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Escalation Levels">
    In the **Escalation Levels** tab:
    - Click **Add Level** to create your first level
    - Configure targets, channels, and timing
    - Add more levels as needed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Policy">
    Click **Create** to save your policy
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuring Escalation Levels

Each level defines who gets notified and how.

### Level Timing

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Level 1">
    Level 1 is triggered immediately when an incident is created.

    The **delay** setting determines how long to wait before escalating to Level 2 if no one acknowledges.

    **Example:** "Escalate to Level 2 after 5 minutes (if no response)"
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Level 2+">
    Subsequent levels trigger after the previous level's timeout expires.

    **Example:** Level 2 with 10-minute delay means it triggers 10 minutes after Level 1 started (if still unacknowledged).
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Final Level">
    The last level has no further escalation. If no one acknowledges:
    - The policy can repeat from Level 1 (if configured)
    - Or the escalation is marked as exhausted
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Notification Targets

Add targets using the dropdown selectors:

| Target Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Users** | Individual team members |
| **Teams** | All members of a team receive notifications |
| **Schedules** | The current on-call person from the schedule |

<Tip>
  Combine target types for comprehensive coverage. For example, Level 1 might target the on-call schedule, while Level 2 adds the entire team.
</Tip>

### Target Mode

Choose how targets are notified:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Parallel" icon="arrows-split-up-and-left">
    **All targets notified simultaneously**

    - Everyone receives notifications at once
    - First person to acknowledge handles it
    - Best for: Time-critical incidents
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sequential" icon="arrow-down-1-9">
    **Targets notified one by one**

    - Moves to next target after max retries
    - Stops when someone acknowledges
    - Best for: Defined escalation order
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Accordion title="Example: Sequential vs Parallel">
  **Scenario:** Level with targets Alice, Bob, Charlie

  **Parallel Mode:**
  - T=0:00 — Alice, Bob, Charlie all receive calls simultaneously
  - T=0:01 — Bob answers and acknowledges
  - Result: Escalation stops, Alice and Charlie calls become moot

  **Sequential Mode:**
  - T=0:00 — Alice receives call (no answer)
  - T=0:30 — Alice retry #1 (no answer)
  - T=1:00 — Alice retry #2 (no answer, max retries reached)
  - T=1:00 — Bob receives call (answers!)
  - Result: Escalation stops, Charlie never contacted
</Accordion>

### Notification Channels

Select which channels to use for notifications:

| Channel | Description | Best For |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Call** | Phone call with retry support | Urgent, must reach someone |
| **SMS** | Text message | Quick notifications |
| **Email** | Email notification | Detailed information, audit trail |
| **Webhook** | Integration notifications | Slack, Teams, custom systems |

<Info>
  Multiple channels can be enabled simultaneously. All selected channels fire in parallel for each target.
</Info>

### Call Retry Settings

When **Call** is enabled, configure retry behavior:

- **Retry Count** (0-5) — How many times to retry after initial call fails
  - Total attempts = 1 + retry count
  - Example: 2 retries = 3 total call attempts

- **Retry Delay** (10-300 seconds) — Wait time between call attempts
  - Default: 30 seconds
  - Gives time for the person to call back

<Accordion title="Example: Call Retry Flow">
  **Settings:** 2 retries, 30-second delay

  ```
  T=0:00  Call attempt #1 → No answer
  T=0:30  Call attempt #2 (retry #1) → No answer
  T=1:00  Call attempt #3 (retry #2) → No answer
  T=1:00  Max retries reached
          → Sequential: Move to next target
          → Parallel: Mark target exhausted
  ```
</Accordion>

### Webhook Selection

When **Webhook** is enabled:

- Select specific webhooks from your configured integrations
- If none selected: All tenant webhooks are triggered
- Webhooks receive full incident details and escalation context

---

## Level Configuration Example

<Accordion title="Example: 3-Level Production Policy">
  **Level 1: On-Call Engineer**
  - Timing: Immediate (0 min delay)
  - Targets: On-Call Schedule "Platform Engineering"
  - Mode: Sequential
  - Channels: Call, SMS
  - Call Retries: 2 (3 total attempts)
  - Retry Delay: 30 seconds
  - Timeout: 5 minutes

  **Level 2: Engineering Team**
  - Timing: 5 minutes after Level 1
  - Targets: Team "Backend Engineering", Engineering Lead (user)
  - Mode: Parallel
  - Channels: Call, SMS, Email
  - Call Retries: 2
  - Timeout: 10 minutes

  **Level 3: Management**
  - Timing: 10 minutes after Level 2
  - Targets: VP Engineering (user)
  - Mode: Parallel
  - Channels: Call, SMS, Email, Webhook (Slack)
  - Call Retries: 2
  - No further escalation
</Accordion>

---

## Repeat Settings

Configure what happens when all levels complete without acknowledgment:

### Repeat Limit

How many times to cycle through the entire policy:
- **1** (default) — Single pass through all levels
- **2** — Policy repeats once (2 total passes)
- **3+** — Multiple repeat cycles

### Repeat Delay

Wait time between policy repeats:
- Default: 30 minutes
- Gives time for the situation to potentially resolve
- Or for responders to become available

<Accordion title="Example: Repeat Cycle">
  **Settings:** repeatLimit=2, repeatDelay=30 min

  ```
  Pass 1:
    Level 1 → Level 2 → Level 3 (no acknowledgment)
    ↓
    [30 minute delay]
    ↓
  Pass 2:
    Level 1 → Level 2 → Level 3 (no acknowledgment)
    ↓
  ESCALATION EXHAUSTED
  (No more repeats, incident marked as exhausted)
  ```
</Accordion>

---

## Reordering Levels

Levels can be reordered after creation:

1. Open the policy for editing
2. Use the **Move Up** (↑) and **Move Down** (↓) arrows
3. Levels are renumbered automatically
4. Save to apply changes

<Note>
  The first level always triggers immediately. Subsequent levels use their delay setting relative to when they're reached.
</Note>

---

## Editing Policies

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the Policy">
    Locate it in the list or use search
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Edit Dialog">
    Click the **three-dot menu** (⋮) and select **Edit**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make Changes">
    Modify settings, add/remove levels, adjust timing
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Click **Save** to apply
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Editing a policy affects all future escalations using it. Active escalations continue with their original configuration.
</Warning>

---

## Duplicating Policies

Create a copy of an existing policy:

1. Click the **three-dot menu** (⋮)
2. Select **Duplicate**
3. A copy opens in the create dialog with "(Copy)" appended to the name
4. Modify as needed and save

<Tip>
  Use duplication to create variants for different scenarios (e.g., business hours vs after-hours versions).
</Tip>

---

## Deleting Policies

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Delete Dialog">
    Click the three-dot menu and select **Delete**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Deletion">
    Review the warning and click **Delete**
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Deleting a policy removes all its levels. Make sure no services or routing rules depend on it.
</Warning>

---

## Escalation Flow Visualization

The policy list shows a preview of each policy's escalation flow:

```
Level 1 (3 targets) → 5m → Level 2 (2 targets) → 10m → Level 3 (1 target)
```

This helps you quickly understand the escalation structure without opening each policy.

---

## Target Resolution

Targets are resolved at escalation time, not when the policy is created:

### User Targets
- Direct notification to the specified user
- Uses their configured contact methods

### Team Targets
- Expands to all current team members
- If membership changes, new escalations use updated membership

### Schedule Targets
- Resolves to whoever is currently on-call
- Handles overrides and rotation automatically
- If no one is on-call (coverage gap), target is skipped

<Info>
  Dynamic resolution means your escalation policies stay current with team and schedule changes.
</Info>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with On-Call">
    Level 1 should typically target an on-call schedule. This ensures the designated responder is contacted first before broader escalation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Increase Reach at Each Level">
    Each level should reach more people or higher authority:
    - Level 1: Individual on-call
    - Level 2: Team or backup
    - Level 3: Management
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Set Appropriate Timeouts">
    Balance urgency with reasonable response time:
    - Critical: 3-5 minute timeouts
    - High: 5-10 minute timeouts
    - Medium: 10-15 minute timeouts
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Multiple Channels">
    Don't rely on a single channel. People might miss calls but see SMS, or vice versa.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Configure Retries Wisely">
    2-3 call retries with 30-second delays gives responders time to answer or call back without excessive notification fatigue.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test Your Policies">
    Create test incidents to verify escalation flows work as expected before relying on them for production.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Document Policy Purpose">
    Use the description field to explain when this policy applies and any special considerations.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Patterns

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="24/7 Critical Response">
    **Level 1:** On-call schedule (sequential, call+SMS, 5 min)
    **Level 2:** Entire team (parallel, call+SMS+email, 10 min)
    **Level 3:** Management (parallel, all channels, 15 min)
    **Repeat:** 2 cycles with 30 min delay
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Business Hours Only">
    **Level 1:** Support team (parallel, email+SMS, 15 min)
    **Level 2:** Team lead (sequential, call+SMS, 10 min)
    **Repeat:** 1 cycle (no repeat)

    Combine with routing rules to use different policies after hours.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Follow-the-Sun">
    Create separate policies for each region:
    - EMEA Policy → EMEA on-call schedule
    - APAC Policy → APAC on-call schedule
    - Americas Policy → Americas on-call schedule

    Use routing rules based on time or incident origin.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="VIP Customer Escalation">
    **Level 1:** Dedicated support (sequential, call+SMS, 3 min)
    **Level 2:** Account team (parallel, all channels, 5 min)
    **Level 3:** Customer success + Management (parallel, 10 min)
    **Repeat:** 3 cycles with 15 min delay
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Escalation Status

Incidents track their escalation status:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Triggered** | Escalation active, Level 1 in progress |
| **Escalated** | Moved to a higher level |
| **Acknowledged** | Someone responded, escalation stopped |
| **Exhausted** | All levels and repeats completed without acknowledgment |

---

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Escalation not starting">
    1. Verify the policy is set to **Active**
    2. Check that a routing rule or default policy is configured
    3. Confirm the service has escalation enabled
    4. Look for initial delay settings that might postpone escalation
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Wrong people being notified">
    1. Check target resolution (teams expand to current members)
    2. Verify schedule is showing correct on-call person
    3. Review target mode (parallel vs sequential)
    4. Check routing rules aren't selecting a different policy
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Notifications not being received">
    1. Verify user contact methods are configured correctly
    2. Check notification channel is enabled for the level
    3. Confirm phone numbers are in correct format
    4. Review webhook configurations if using integrations
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Escalation stopping too early">
    1. Someone may have acknowledged without you knowing
    2. Check incident status in the incident timeline
    3. Verify level timeout settings are sufficient
    4. Review call retry settings
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Escalation continuing after acknowledgment">
    1. Ensure acknowledgment was properly recorded
    2. Check for multiple simultaneous escalations
    3. Verify the incident ID matches
    4. Review incident timeline for acknowledgment event
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
