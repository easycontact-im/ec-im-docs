## Overview

Teams are the foundation of your incident response structure. By grouping responders into teams, you can efficiently manage on-call rotations, assign incidents, and configure escalation policies. Teams make it easy to notify the right people when incidents occur.

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Why Use Teams?

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Incident Routing">
    Route incidents to the right group of people automatically:

    - **By Service** — Database Team, API Team, Frontend Team
    - **By Region** — EMEA Support, APAC Support, Americas Support
    - **By Expertise** — Security Team, Performance Team, Infrastructure Team

    When an incident is assigned to a team, all members can see and respond to it.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Escalation Policies">
    Teams integrate seamlessly with escalation policies:

    - Add entire teams as escalation targets
    - Notify all team members simultaneously
    - Combine with individual users and schedules
    - Configure parallel or sequential notification

    This ensures incidents reach the right people even during complex escalation flows.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="On-Call Management">
    Teams work together with schedules for on-call rotations:

    - Define who's available to respond
    - Set up rotation schedules within teams
    - Assign default escalation policies
    - Track team availability
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Deactivating vs. Deleting Teams

### Deactivating Teams

Deactivate a team to temporarily disable it while preserving its configuration:

1. Edit the team
2. Set status to **Inactive**
3. Save changes

**Inactive teams:**

- Won't appear in escalation target selections
- Members remain associated
- Can be reactivated at any time
- Historical data preserved

### Deleting Teams

Delete a team to permanently remove it:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Delete Dialog">
    Click the **three-dot menu** (⋮) and select **Delete**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Deletion">
    Read the warning and click **Delete** to confirm
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Deleting a team removes all member associations and cannot be undone. Consider deactivating instead if you might need the team again.
</Warning>

## Teams in Escalation Policies

Teams are powerful targets for escalation policies, allowing you to notify multiple responders at once.

### Adding Teams to Escalations

When configuring an escalation policy:

1. Add a new level or edit existing
2. Select **Team** as the target type
3. Choose the team from the dropdown
4. Configure notification channels

### Notification Behavior

When a team is notified through an escalation:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Parallel Mode" icon="arrows-split-up-and-left">
    All team members are notified simultaneously. First responder handles the incident.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sequential Mode" icon="arrow-down-1-9">
    Team members are notified one by one until someone acknowledges.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Mixed Targets

Escalation levels can combine different target types:

- Individual users
- Teams
- On-call schedules

This flexibility allows complex notification flows tailored to your organization.

<Accordion title="Example: Multi-Level Escalation">
  **Level 1** (0 min):

  - On-Call Schedule: "Primary On-Call"

  **Level 2** (5 min):

  - Team: "Backend Engineering"
  - Mode: Parallel

  **Level 3** (15 min):

  - User: "Engineering Manager"
  - Team: "Leadership"

  This ensures the on-call person is notified first, then the entire team if no response, and finally leadership for critical situations.
</Accordion>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep Teams Focused">
    Each team should have a clear responsibility area. Avoid creating catch-all teams that include everyone—they become noise rather than signal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Right-Size Your Teams">
    Teams should be large enough to provide coverage but small enough that members feel ownership. 5-10 members is often ideal for on-call teams.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Descriptive Names">
    Team names should clearly indicate their purpose:

    **Good:** "Payment Processing Team", "EU Customer Support"

    **Avoid:** "Team A", "Engineers", "Support"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Document Team Purpose">
    Use the description field to explain:

    - What services/areas the team owns
    - When to escalate to this team
    - Team lead or contact person
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Regular Membership Reviews">
    Periodically review team membership:

    - Remove people who've left or changed roles
    - Add new team members promptly
    - Verify contact information is current
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Integrate with Escalations">
    Don't create teams in isolation. Plan how they'll be used in escalation policies to ensure proper incident routing.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Team members not receiving notifications">
    1. Verify the team is set to **Active**
    2. Check that members have valid contact methods configured
    3. Confirm the team is properly added to the escalation policy
    4. Verify the escalation policy is assigned to the service
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't find a team in escalation dropdown">
    1. Check if the team is set to **Active** (inactive teams don't appear)
    2. Refresh the page to load latest teams
    3. Verify you have permission to view teams
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't add a user to the team">
    1. Verify the user exists in your organization
    2. Check if they're already a member (they won't appear in dropdown)
    3. Ensure you have write permission for teams
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Slug already exists error">
    Each team slug must be unique within your organization. Choose a different slug or modify the existing team instead.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can't delete a team">
    Check if the team is referenced in:

    - Active escalation policies
    - Incident assignments

    Remove these references before deleting, or deactivate the team instead.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Teams vs. Groups

Teams and Groups serve different purposes in EasyContact:

| Aspect       | Teams                                       | Groups                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**  | Incident response and escalations           | Access control and permissions    |
| **Used For** | On-call, incident assignment, notifications | Role assignment, feature access   |
| **Found In** | Escalation policies, incidents              | User management, IAM              |
| **Members**  | Responders for specific services            | Users needing similar permissions |

<Tip>
  Use **Teams** for operational structure (who responds to incidents) and **Groups** for access control (who can do what in the platform).
