## Overview

Schedules define who is on-call and when. By creating rotation schedules, you ensure there's always someone available to respond to incidents. EasyAlert's scheduling system supports flexible rotation patterns, multiple coverage layers, time-based restrictions, and temporary overrides.

## Understanding Schedules

A schedule consists of several key components:

### Rotation Type

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Daily Rotation">
    The on-call person changes every day at the specified handoff time.

    **Best for:**
    - High-volume alert environments
    - Distributing load evenly
    - Teams that prefer short shifts

    **Example:**
    - Handoff time: 09:00
    - Monday: Alice → Tuesday: Bob → Wednesday: Carol → ...

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Weekly Rotation">
    The on-call person changes once per week on the specified day and time.

    **Best for:**
    - Lower-volume environments
    - Deeper context during shifts
    - Teams with longer handoff processes

    **Example:**
    - Handoff: Monday at 09:00
    - Week 1: Alice → Week 2: Bob → Week 3: Carol → ...

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Layers

Layers allow multiple rotation tracks within a single schedule. Each layer can have its own users and restrictions.

<Accordion title="Example: Multi-Layer Schedule">
  **Primary Layer (Priority 1)**
  - Users: Alice, Bob, Carol
  - Rotation: Weekly
  - Active: 24/7

**Weekend Layer (Priority 2)**

- Users: Dave, Eve
- Rotation: Weekly
- Active: Saturday-Sunday only

**Result:** During weekdays, only the primary layer is active. On weekends, both layers provide coverage, with primary taking precedence.

</Accordion>

### Restrictions

Layers can be restricted to specific times or days:

| Restriction Type | Description                  | Example                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Time-based**   | Active during specific hours | 09:00 - 18:00 (business hours) |
| **Day-based**    | Active on specific days      | Monday - Friday (weekdays)     |
| **Overnight**    | Spans across midnight        | 18:00 - 09:00 (night shift)    |

<Tip>
  Combine restrictions to create complex coverage patterns. For example, a
  "Weekend Nights" layer could be active Saturday-Sunday, 20:00-08:00.
</Tip>

## Viewing Schedules

The Schedules list shows all your on-call schedules:

| Column          | Description                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Schedule**    | Name and description             |
| **Rotation**    | Daily or Weekly badge            |
| **On-Call Now** | Current on-call person(s)        |
| **Layers**      | Number of layers and total users |
| **Timezone**    | Schedule's timezone              |
| **Status**      | Active or Inactive               |

### On-Call Status

The "On-Call Now" column shows who's currently responsible:

- **User avatar** — The current on-call person
- **Multiple avatars** — Multiple layers active simultaneously
- **Override badge** — An override is in effect

---

## Creating Schedules

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Create Dialog">Click the **Create Schedule** button</Step>
  <Step title="Configure Basic Settings">
    In the **Schedule Settings** tab: - **Name** — Descriptive name (e.g.,
    "Platform Engineering On-Call") - **Timezone** — The timezone for handoff
    times - **Description** — Optional explanation - **Rotation Type** — Daily
    or Weekly - **Handoff Time** — When rotation changes occur - **Handoff Day**
    — For weekly, which day of the week
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Rotation Layers">
    In the **Rotation Layers** tab: - Click **Add Layer** - Name the layer
    (e.g., "Primary") - Select users in rotation order - Configure restrictions
    if needed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Schedule">Click **Create** to save your schedule</Step>
</Steps>

### Setting Up Rotation Order

When selecting users for a layer, the order matters:

1. Check users in the order they should rotate
2. The first user checked rotates first
3. View the rotation order with numbered badges (#1, #2, #3...)

<Info>
  The rotation order determines who's on-call first. Make sure to order users
  correctly when setting up the layer.
</Info>

## Configuring Layers

### Adding a Layer

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Add Layer">
    In the Rotation Layers tab, click **Add Layer**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name the Layer">
    Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Primary", "Weekend Coverage", "Night
    Shift")
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Users">Check users in the desired rotation order</Step>
  <Step title="Set Restrictions (Optional)">
    Configure when this layer should be active
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Configuring Time Restrictions

To limit when a layer is active:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Time Restriction">
    Toggle on the time restriction option
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Hours">
    - **Start Time** — When the layer becomes active - **End Time** — When the
    layer becomes inactive
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle Overnight">
    For overnight shifts (e.g., 18:00 - 08:00), the system automatically handles
    the day transition
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Configuring Day Restrictions

To limit which days a layer is active:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Day Restriction">
    Toggle on the day restriction option
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Days">
    Click on the days when this layer should be active (Monday through Sunday)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Layer Priority

When multiple layers are active simultaneously:

- **Lower index = Higher priority**
- The first layer (Primary) takes precedence
- All active layers are displayed in the on-call view

<Warning>
  Ensure at least one layer covers all time periods to avoid coverage gaps.
</Warning>

## Schedule Detail View

Click on a schedule to see its detail page with:

### Calendar View

A monthly calendar showing:

- **Gray cells** — Normal rotation coverage
- **Blue cells** — Override in effect
- **Red cells** — Coverage gap detected

Click any day to see detailed on-call information.

### On-Call Timeline

Shows daily coverage with:

- Primary user (PRI badge)
- Secondary users (SEC badge)
- Override users (OVR badge)
- Layer assignments
- Time restrictions

### Current On-Call

Displays who's on-call right now:

- User name and avatar
- Layer they're covering
- Override indicator if applicable
- Time until next handoff

### Coverage Gaps

---

## Managing Overrides

Overrides let you temporarily change who's on-call without modifying the rotation.

### Creating an Override

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Override Dialog">
    On the schedule detail page, click **Add Override**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select User">Choose who will be on-call during this period</Step>
  <Step title="Set Date Range">
    - **Start** — When the override begins - **End** — When the override ends
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Reason (Optional)">
    Document why this override exists (e.g., "Alice on vacation")
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Override">Click **Create** to activate the override</Step>
</Steps>

### Override Behavior

- Overrides take **highest priority** over all layers
- Override applies to the **entire schedule**, not just one layer
- Multiple overrides can exist but shouldn't overlap
- Past overrides remain for historical reference

### Common Override Scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Vacation Coverage">
    When Alice is on vacation for a week: - Create override for the full
    vacation period - Assign to the backup person (e.g., Bob) - Add reason:
    "Alice on PTO"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Shift Swap">
    When Bob and Carol want to swap shifts: - Create override for Bob's shift,
    assign to Carol - Create override for Carol's shift, assign to Bob - Add
    reason: "Shift swap agreed"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Emergency Coverage">
    When the scheduled person is unavailable: - Create immediate override
    starting now - Assign to available team member - Delete when original person
    returns
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Deleting Overrides

1. Find the override in the Active Overrides list
2. Click the delete button (trash icon)
3. Confirm deletion

<Note>
  Deleting an override immediately returns to the normal rotation. The original
  on-call person becomes active.
</Note>

## Understanding Coverage Gaps

Coverage gaps occur when no layer is active for a time period.

### How Gaps Happen

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Missing Day Coverage">
    A layer is set to weekdays only, but no layer covers weekends.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Missing Time Coverage">
    One layer covers 09:00-18:00, another covers 22:00-06:00, but 18:00-22:00 is
    uncovered.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Empty Layers">
    A layer has no users assigned during its active period.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Detecting Gaps

The schedule detail page automatically analyzes coverage:

- Checks the next 30 days by default
- Shows gap periods with start/end times
- Calculates total uncovered hours

### Fixing Gaps

1. Add users to cover the gap period
2. Extend layer restrictions to cover more time
3. Add a new layer specifically for the gap period
4. Create standing overrides if gaps are intentional

<Warning>
  Coverage gaps mean incidents during those periods won't have an on-call
  responder. Always resolve gaps for critical schedules.
</Warning>

---

## Timezone Handling

Schedules operate in a specific timezone:

- **Handoff times** are in the schedule's timezone
- **Overrides** use ISO format with timezone info
- **Calendar view** displays in the schedule's timezone

<Tip>
  For global teams, create separate schedules per region, each in the
  appropriate timezone, and use escalation policies to chain them together.
</Tip>

---

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Simple">
    Begin with a single layer covering 24/7. Add complexity (multiple layers,
    restrictions) only when needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Ensure Full Coverage">
    After any change, check the calendar view and gap detection to verify there
    are no uncovered periods.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Meaningful Names">
    Name schedules and layers clearly: - **Schedule:** "Backend Engineering
    On-Call" - **Layers:** "Primary", "Weekend Backup", "Night Shift"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Plan for Absences">
    - Document the override process for your team - Set up overrides in advance
    for known absences - Have a backup plan for unexpected unavailability
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Right-Size Rotations">
    - Daily rotations work well for 5+ person teams - Weekly rotations suit
    smaller teams - Consider alert volume when choosing rotation length
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review Regularly">
    - Check schedules when team membership changes - Verify coverage after
    organizational changes - Archive inactive schedules to reduce clutter
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Schedules in Escalation Policies

Schedules integrate with escalation policies as notification targets:

1. Add a schedule as an escalation target
2. When the escalation level triggers:
   - The current on-call person is determined
   - That person receives the notification
3. If no one is on-call (gap), the escalation continues to the next level

<Accordion title="Example: Schedule in Escalation">
  **Level 1:** Schedule "Backend On-Call"
  - Notifies whoever is currently on-call
  - 5-minute timeout

**Level 2:** Team "Backend Engineering"

- If no acknowledgment, notifies entire team
- 10-minute timeout

**Level 3:** User "Engineering Manager"

- Final escalation to management
  </Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Wrong person showing as on-call">
    1. Check the schedule's timezone matches your expectation 2. Verify the
    handoff time hasn't passed 3. Look for active overrides that might change
    assignments 4. Check layer restrictions that might exclude the expected user
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Coverage gaps appearing unexpectedly">
    1. Review all layer restrictions 2. Ensure time restrictions don't leave
    gaps 3. Check day restrictions cover all days 4. Verify layers have users
    assigned
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Override not taking effect">
    1. Verify the override start time has passed 2. Check the override end time
    hasn't passed 3. Confirm the override is for the correct schedule 4. Refresh
    the page to see latest data
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rotation not advancing">
    1. Check the rotation type (daily vs weekly) 2. Verify the handoff time/day
    settings 3. Confirm the schedule timezone is correct 4. Ensure there are
    multiple users in the rotation
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Notifications going to wrong person">
    1. Check escalation policy is using correct schedule 2. Verify current
    on-call in schedule detail view 3. Look for overrides that might redirect 4.
    Check user's notification settings
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
