## Never Miss a Critical Alert

Intelligent incident management that ensures the right people are notified at the right time.

---

## The Problem

Modern infrastructure generates thousands of alerts. Without proper management:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Alert Fatigue" icon="bell-slash">
    Teams become desensitized to constant notifications and miss critical issues
  </Card>
  <Card title="Slow Response" icon="hourglass-half">
    Finding the right person to respond wastes precious minutes during outages
  </Card>
  <Card title="Coverage Gaps" icon="user-xmark">
    Unclear on-call schedules lead to incidents with no responder

    *Wait 5 minutes for acknowledgment*
  </Step>
  <Step title="Level 3: Team Lead">
