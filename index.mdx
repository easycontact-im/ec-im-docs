## How It Works

EasyContact sits between your monitoring tools and your response team, ensuring alerts reach the right people through the right channels.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Alert Triggered" icon="bell">
    Your monitoring tools (Zabbix, Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, etc.) detect an issue and send an alert to EasyContact via webhook
  </Step>
  <Step title="Intelligent Processing" icon="brain">
    EasyContact evaluates alert rules to filter noise, then applies escalation routing to determine the right policy
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find On-Call Responder" icon="calendar-check">
    The escalation policy checks who is currently on-call based on your schedules
  </Step>
  <Step title="Multi-Channel Notification" icon="tower-broadcast">
    Responders are notified via their preferred channels: Call, SMS, Email, Push, or Webhooks (Slack/Teams)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Escalate if Needed" icon="arrow-up">
    If no one acknowledges, EasyContact automatically escalates to the next level until someone responds
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Core Capabilities

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Alert Rules" icon="filter">
    Filter, transform, and control incoming alerts before they become incidents.

    - **Suppress noise** — Drop alerts from development or staging environments
    - **Normalize severity** — Standardize severity levels across different tools
    - **Enrich alerts** — Add tags for routing and categorization
    - **Transform fields** — Modify alert properties before incident creation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Escalation Routing" icon="route">
    Route incidents to specific escalation policies based on alert attributes.

    - **Match on any field** — Severity, host, service, environment, custom tags
    - **Flexible conditions** — 13 operators including regex, in, exists
    - **Priority-based** — First matching rule wins
    - **Initial delay** — Allow time for auto-resolution before escalating
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="On-Call Schedules" icon="calendar-days">
    Create rotation schedules to ensure 24/7 coverage with automatic handoffs.

    - **Daily or weekly rotations** — Configurable handoff times
    - **Multiple layers** — Primary, secondary, and specialized coverage
    - **Time restrictions** — Business hours, nights, or weekends
    - **Temporary overrides** — Handle vacations and shift swaps
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Escalation Policies" icon="stairs">
    Define multi-level escalation policies that notify the right people in sequence.

    - **Multiple levels** — Escalate through teams until acknowledged
    - **Flexible targeting** — Users, contacts, schedules, or teams
    - **Parallel or sequential** — Notify all at once or one by one
    - **Automatic retries** — Retry calls if not answered
    - **Repeat cycles** — Keep escalating until resolved
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
